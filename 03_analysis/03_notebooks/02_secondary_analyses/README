Tangential analyses that may not be part of the main scope, or don't fit into a 'progressive' structure for the main analysis. Ideally, the name should incorporate which of the 'primary' analysis steps this is an offshoot from. E.g., if you started looking into something more extensively in the 03.rmd primary script, you would call the notebook here 03.1 or something to refer to the entry point.
